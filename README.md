# Playwright Automation Suite - https://automationintesting.online/

Technical assessment

## Installation

Using npm

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

## Running tests
Open project folder in Visual Studio Code

In terminal:
```bash
npx playwright test
```
When the tests have completed running, a html report with supporting screenshots and videos will generate and should open directly in your web browser. If it does not open upon completion you can navigate to the terminal and control+click on the 'http://localhost:9323' url
## Notes

This was my first attempt at writing a automation suite and framework using Playwright and Typescript.
I have written 2 tests that interact with the react calendar but had to skip them within the test suite as I struggled to simulate the drag and drop action required in code,
I would appreciate it if you could point out where I went wrong as it was quite annoying and have left my attempted code in for viewing.

## Future Plans
I plan on iterating on this project to provide a higher coverage on validation, security and usability testing and inclusion of API tests
