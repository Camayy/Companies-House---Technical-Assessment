# Playwright Automation Suite - https://automationintesting.online/

Technical assessment

## Installation

Using npm

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

## Running tests
Open project folder in Visual Studio Code

In terminal:
```bash
npx playwright test
```
When the tests have completed running, a html report with supporting screenshots and videos will generate and should open directly in your web browser. If it does not open upon completion you can navigate to the terminal and control+click on the 'http://localhost:9323' url

## Future Plans
I plan on iterating on this project to provide a higher coverage on validation, security and usability testing and inclusion of API tests
